# CoDJumper Map Generator

CoDJumper Map Generator, or CJMG for short, is a tool to auto-generate CoDJumper maps with some parameters you have specified to control the output. The tool is still under development and will probably see large changes in its codebase so I'm not comfortable with sharing the source code yet. I will do that with the 1.0 release.

Until then, I will release periodic releases of maps I've generated using the tool and put them under the downloads folder. You have my permission to host these maps on any server and/or include any parts of the map sources into your own maps.
